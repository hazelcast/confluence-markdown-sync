# Confluence Markdown Sync Action

This Github Action serves the purpose of copying the contents of a Markdown `.md` file to a Confluence Cloud Page.

## Getting Started

```yml
# .github/workflows/my-workflow.yml
on: [push]

jobs:
  dev:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - uses: hazelcast/confluence-markdown-sync@v1
        with:
          from: './README.md'
          to: '123456' # The confluence page id where to write the output
          cloud: <my-confluence-cloud-id>
          user: <my.user@example.org>
          token: <my-token>
          content_prefix: 'Page autogenerated by confluence-markdown-sync'
```

## Authentication

Uses basic auth for the rest api.

- `cloud`: The ID can be found by looking at your confluence domain: `https://<cloud>.atlassian.net/...`

- `user`: The user that generated the access token

- `token`: You can generate the token [here](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens). Link to [Docs](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/api-tokens-938839638.html)

- `to`: The page ID can be found by simply navigating to the page where you want the content to be postet to and looke at the url. It will look something like this: `https://<cloud-id>.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/<space>/pages/<page-id>/<title>`

- `content_prefix`: (optional) The prefix for the content pushed to confluence

### Using secrets

It's **higly reccomended** that you use secrets!

To use them you need them to specify them before in your repo. [Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets)

Then you can use them in any input field.

```yml
# .github/workflows/my-workflow.yml
# ...
token: ${{ secrets.token }}
```

## Known Limitations

For now images will not be uploaded [see ticket](https://github.com/cupcakearmy/confluence-markdown-sync/issues/5), they would require extra steps. If anyone feedls brave enough, constributions are welcomed :)

## Development

1. Clone the repo
2. Install [act](https://github.com/nektos/act)
3. Create the same config in the repo folder as in the getting started section above.
4. Change `uses: hazelcast/confluence-markdown-sync` -> `uses: ./`
5. Create an example markdown file `Some.md` and set it in the config `from: './Some.md'`
6. Run locally `act -b`

### With secrets

You can simply create a `.secrets` file and specify it to `act`.

```
TOKEN=abc123
```

```yml
# .github/workflows/dev.yml
# ...
token: ${{ secrets.token }}
```

```bash
act -b --secret-file .secrets
```
